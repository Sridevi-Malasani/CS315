Breakpoints & Containers
Breakpoints are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes in Bootstrap.
Breakpoint 	Class 
			infix 	Dimensions
X-Small 	None 	<576px
Small 		sm 		≥576px
Medium 		md 		≥768px
Large 		lg 		≥992px
Extra large xl 		≥1200px
Extra extra 
large 		xxl 	≥1400px

Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.  Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.
    .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
    .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints
    .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint

Typography

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed.

The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process.
Display headings

Traditional heading elements are designed to work best in the meat of your page content. When you need a heading to stand out, consider using a display heading—a larger, slightly more opinionated heading 
style.

<p>You can use the mark tag to <mark>highlight</mark> text.</p>
<p><del>This line of text is meant to be treated as deleted text.</del></p>
<p><s>This line of text is meant to be treated as no longer accurate.</s></p>
<p><ins>This line of text is meant to be treated as an addition to the document.</ins></p>
<p><u>This line of text will render as underlined.</u></p>
<p><small>This line of text is meant to be treated as fine print.</small></p>
<p><strong>This line rendered as bold text.</strong></p>
<p><em>This line rendered as italicized text.</em></p>
